## Pseudocode
I want to play a Rock-Paper-Scissors game against my computer!

I want to select between "rock", "paper" and "scissors"
The computer must select a random option between "rock", "paper" and "scissors"

```
WHILE (player_victory !== 5) || (computer_victory !==) DO
  WHEN I select one of the options
    IF my selection beats the computer selection
      I win! ++player_victory
    END
    IF the computer selection beats mine
      I lose! ++computer_victory
    END
  END
END
```

Whoever gets 5 victories first wins!!

```
IF player_victory == 5
  I win the game!
END
```
```
IF computer_victory == 5
  I lose the game!
END
```
